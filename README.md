# MultiPong

MultiPong is a Work-In-Progress game developed in C# using the MonoGame (XNA) framework.

It's a simple pong clone for one player in which you choose the number of vertices of your polygon and you play pong switching between paddles. The idea is to recreate this program using socket programming to create a full MultiPong online.

## Aims
This software is produced by me, an individual developer, for the purposes of self improvement. Below is a list of aims that I hope this project will help me achieve:

* Provide a program that I can use to build my network programming.
* Improve computational understanding of drawing n-sided polygons.
